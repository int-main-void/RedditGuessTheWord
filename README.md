# Instructions for using the app

The game is pretty straightforward and self-explanatory. Simply click 'play' to start, and then click letters on the on-screen keyboard. 

## Test cases

1. new user - should get 10 points and a play button to start the game
2. user with points - play game, accumulate positive points
3. user with points - lose points in a game but don't go to zero
4. user with points - make enough bad guesses to drop below zero. Should get a 'come back tomorrow' screen
5. user with no points - should get a 'come back tomorrow' screen on app load, and no play button
6. user with no points - come back tomorrow and should return to case 1.
